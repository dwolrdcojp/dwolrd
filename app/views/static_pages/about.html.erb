  <h1>About</h1><br>
<div style="font-size:18px">

The POWER SHOP is the outgrowth of a deep love for Japanese cars and the addiction to buying rare parts to build the ultimate king of dope machine.  The POWER SHOP sets out to simplify the way we acquire those to-die-for parts. Our goal is to unite the community and eliminate the hassle of finding or selling parts. It's hard enough trying to sift through Yahoo Auctions Japan or out-dated car forums to make your build a reality. Sell your parts, stack some dough, buy cooler parts, and then <a href="http://www.showup-asahi.com/">SHOWup SHOWoff</a>.  <br><br>

<h2>History</h2>

The POWER SHOP is a descendent of the 2009-2014 DRIFTWOLRD website that served as a curation 3000+ photos of the very best styled drift cars from all over the wolrd. In an age of rampant fake parts and ugly pro drift cars, DRIFTWOLRD kept the spirit of Japanese grass roots drifting alive. The name comes from the now discontinued Battle Magazine that featured an advertisement in the back pages that read "DRIFT the WOLRD" next to pictures of shiny new body kits. The DRIFTWOLRD name and its spelling error immediately just stuck.
